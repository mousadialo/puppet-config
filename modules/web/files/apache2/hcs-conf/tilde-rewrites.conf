  # The reference documentation at
  #   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html
  # has a useful diagram for the crazy control/data flow here.
  # In particular, `$1' in a RewriteCond is bound
  # by the regexp in the *following* RewriteRule.

  # Conditions on all rules:
  ## if the usual /foo doesn't exist,
  ## and the group or member account foo does (and has a web directory).
  # N.B. (joe, 2009.09.05) This condition may very likely be silly.
  #   Most conflicts will not be caused by actual files in the DocumentRoot,
  #   but rather by other magical redirects (e.g., /rb --> .../reviewboard),
  #   where no actual directory rb exists. TODO: consider `-U' (from the docs:
  #   `is existing URL, via subrequest')?

  # Note that whenever we end a rule with the option [R] (or [R=HTTP_code]),
  #   signifying a redirect, we should also include [L] (signifying that no
  #   other rules should be processed), since [R] rewrites the path from
  #   relative-to-root to a full HTTP URL.

  # === RULE: Snapshot prohibition ===
  # Security: redirect access to filer snapshots to
  #           current homepage for user/group
  # Disabled since virgil, our new filer (2009), doesn't keep snapshots here.
  # RewriteRule ^/([^/]+)/\.snapshot/.*$ /$1/ [R=301,L]

  # === RULE: User-directory slashifying ===
  # If foo is a member or group account,
  #   and ~foo/web/bar/baz is a directory,
  #   canonicalize:
  #     /foo/bar/baz --301 Moved Permanently--> /foo/bar/baz/
  #     /~foo/bar/baz --301 Moved Permanently--> /~foo/bar/baz/
  # This is not strictly necessary, since apache will do this
  #   automagically, but if we don't do it ourselves, then we
  #   may have a case like:
  #     /~foo/bar/baz --> /foo/bar/baz
  #                   --(internal, to prep for mod_userdir)--> /~foo/bar/baz
  #                   --(mod_userdir external redirect)--> /~foo/bar/baz/
  #                   --> ...
  #   and the user sees an tilde even though there wasn't one in their request.
  #   This violates the Tilde Prime Directive.
  # (We would like to canoncalize on tilde-free names generally, but it turns
  #   out that people hard-code paths with tildes in various scripty places,
  #   and clients turn out to be surprised when these paths are answered
  #   with a redirect.)
  # Note that this is also valid when /bar/baz is the empty string,
  #   i.e. /foo -> /foo/.
  # Bound variable guide:
  #   In /foo/bar/baz --> /foo/bar/baz:
  #     $1 is foo
  #     $2 is foo
  #     $3 is /bar/baz
  #   In /~foo/bar/baz --> /foo/bar/baz:
  #     $1 is ~foo
  #     $2 is foo
  #     $3 is /bar/baz
  RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$2 !-d
  RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$2 !-f
  RewriteCond /home/groups/$2/web/$3 -d [OR]
  RewriteCond /home/people/$2/web/$3 -d
  RewriteRule ^/(~?([^/~]+))($|/.*[^/])$ /$1$3/ [R=301,L]

  # === RULE: Preparation and invocation of mod_userdir ===
  # If foo is a member or group account and /foo/bar/baz is requested,
  #   internally prepend a tilde to make the input acceptable to mod_userdir,
  #   then pass through ([PT]) to it.
  # N.B. As far as I (joe, 2009.09.05) can tell, we must invoke this rule last,
  #   since [PT] will cause control flow to fall into the abyss of mod_userdir,
  #   never to be heard from again. (FTW)
  # Bound variable guide:
  #   In /foo/bar/baz --> /~foo/bar/baz:
  #   $1 is foo/bar/baz
  #   $2 is foo
